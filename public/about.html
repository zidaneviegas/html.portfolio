  talking about the journey of coding i always had an interest in coding. And i know most of you
  will be thinking why Bcom(Bachelors in commerce)you would have taken Bscit(Bachelors in computers science).
  i was really confused about my future that what i should take in order to achieve success. But 
  nobody gave me proper guidance about what course should you take in oreder to become a successfull
  web developer. And i ended up taking Bcom.

  After a lot of confusion i got into. I started doing a lot of research of how to become a succesfull 
  web developer, i started searching for online resources to get a course in web developing. as well as 
  a certificate for my completation of my course. After a lot of research i finally found about 
  Angela Yu who is a genius is the field of computer. And at that moment i realised that she is

  for the amazing work she does, May God Bless Her Abunduntly.
